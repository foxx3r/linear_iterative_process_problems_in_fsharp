# linear_iterative_process_problems_in_fsharp
This repository is to present my solution for common recursive algorithms (like fibonacci 'nd factorial)

To run the script, clone this repository and run:

`$ fsharpi`

And then, import the file with:

`> #load "linear_iterative_process.fs" ;;`

And now, you will be able to run both factorial and fibonacci, or something else that is in the file, e.g:

```
> Iterative.factorial 6 ;;
val it : int = 720
```
